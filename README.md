# trivia-app


This is a basic trivia app that dynamically generates true/false questions using the OpenTrivia API. This was made a while ago for practice on tkinter and is now being moved to GitHub.

Currently each game is 10 questions, but it is pretty easy to change.

Simply go to the data.py file, and change the AMOUNT_OF_QUESTIONS constant to whatever you desire.

Run the app by running the main.py file.
